# Machine Learning Course

This repository contains the public material for my Machine Learning course: [lectures](#-lectures), [tutorials](#️-tutorials), [lab works](#-labs) and [resources](#-resources).

I have tried to write them in such a way that they should be accessible to anyone wanting to learn the subject, regardless of whether you are one of my students or not.

### 💡 Resources

- [Python](https://github.com/bpesquet/python)

## Usage

> [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) needs to be available on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bpesquet/mlcourse.git
cd mlcourse
uv sync
uv run python {path to example file}
```

## Development notes

### Toolchain

This project is built with the following software:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project management;
- [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting and linting;
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for testing.

### Useful commands

```bash
# Format all Python files
uvx ruff format

# Lint all Python files and fix any fixable errors
uvx ruff check --fix

# Run all code examples as unit tests.
# The optional -s flag prints code output.
uv run pytest [-s]
```
