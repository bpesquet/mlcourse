# Machine Learning Course

This repository contains the material for my Machine Learning course: [lecture notes](notes/), [code examples](mlcourse/) and [lab works](labs/).

I have tried to write them in such a way that they should be accessible to anyone wanting to learn the subject, regardless of whether you are one of my students or not.

## Table of Contents

- Machine Learning: an introduction [ [notes](notes/ml_introduction/README.md) ]

### Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a subset of Machine Learning in which expected results are fed into the system alongside training data.

- Principles of supervised learning [ [notes](notes/supervised_learning_principles/README.md) ]
- 👨🏻‍💻 Essential tools [ [lab](labs/essential_tools.md) ]
- Predict California housing prices [ [notes](notes/predict_california_housing_prices/README.md) | [code](mlcourse/test_predict_california_housing_prices.py) ]
- Recognize handwritten digits [ [notes]() | [code]() ]
- 👩🏻‍💻 Predict heart disease [ [lab]() | [code]() ]
- Linear Regression [ [notes](notes/linear_regression/README.md) | [code](mlcourse/test_linear_regression.py) ]
- Decision Trees & Random Forests [ [notes](notes/decision_trees_random_forests/README.md) | [code]() ]

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning based on the usage of large (deep) neural networks trained on vast amounts of data.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a subset of Machine Learning concerned with the maximization of rewards in a dynamic environment.
